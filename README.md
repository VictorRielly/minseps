Rotation Systems and minimally separating rotation Systems 

This is my code for working with rotation systems on graphs.
This code will be able to compute rotation system duals, and
will have functionality to compute all minimally separating
sets in a fixed genus 2d orientable manifold. This code will
implement a polynomial time rotation system isomorphism test.
